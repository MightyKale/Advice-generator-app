## My process
Started with creating containers in HTML, spent a l-------o-------n-------g time working on (and learning) CSS, especially positioning elements, and surprisingly the actual script.js didn't take longer than 20 minutes.  

### Built with

- HTML, CSS and JS

### What I learned
Like I said earlier, I've learned a lot on positioning elements and how to center them. I can't really distinguish between align-items and text-align, and also had trouble using positions (fix, relative, absolute, inline, block etc.). To be honest, I still didn't get a clear understanding of those, but I am starting to get a sense of how and when to use them. 

- Something specific that I learned is to center an item with the code below:
```css
.container {
  left: 50%;
  top: 50%;
  transform:translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```
- another thing I learned is to build responsive div without using media query, but just simply set a standard width with an actual number and a max-width of a percentage.


### Continued development

I will continue to do more challenges and hopefully I can speed up my CSS coding. 
I also want to practice more on positioning as well.
